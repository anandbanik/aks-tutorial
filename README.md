## Kubernetes

### About Kubernetes
Kubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

### Features
1. Start, stop, update, and manage a cluster of machines running containers in a consistent and maintainable way.
2. Particularly suited for horizontally scaleable, stateless, or 'microservices' application architectures.
3. Additional functionality to make containers easier to use in a cluster (reachability and discovery).
4. Kubernetes does NOT and will not expose all of the 'features' of the docker command line.

### Components

1. <b>Master</b>:- It typically consists of </br>
a) kube-apiserver</br>
b) kube-scheduler</br>
c) kube-controller-manager</br>
d) etcd</br>
e) kube-proxy</br>

2. <b>Node</b>:- It typically consists of </br>
a) kubelet</br>
b) kube-proxy</br>
c) cAdvisor</br>

3. <b>Pods</b>:-</br>
a) Single schedulable unit of work which neither move nor spans across machines.</br>
b) Usually one or more container</br>
c) Metadata about the container(s)</br>
d) Env vars â€“ configuration for the container</br>
e) Every pod gets an unique IP by the container engine</br>

4. <b>Deployment</b>:-</br>
A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

5.  <b>Services</b>:-</br>
<p>
a) How 'stuff' finds pods which could be anywhere</br>
b) Define:
    <ul>
    <li> What port in the container</li>
    <li> Labels on pods which should respond to this type of request</li>
    </ul>
c) Can define:
    <ul>
    <li> What the 'internal' IP should be</li>
    <li> What the 'external' IP should be</li>
    <li> What port the service should listen on</li>
    </ul>
</p>
